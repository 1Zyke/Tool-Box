# Tool-Box
This is an application that serves to perform several tasks. 

Among the following tasks that can be performed through a menu that we can display the views our application will contain the following:  

1- Startup view showing a toolbox, since this application will be useful for several things. A bit simple, but efficient.

2 - People gender generator, which when entering the name of a person will predict the gender to which it belongs, showing a color in the navigation bar depending on the gender and changing the color of the gender of the message displayed on the screen depending on the gender.

3- View that accepts a person's name and determines the age of the person. Depending on the age it will show a message if it is a baby, child, youth, adult or elderly. Also, display an image related to the person's condition.

4- View to accept a country in English and display all the universities in that country with their name and link to the official website.

5- View that displays today's weather in the Dominican Republic.
