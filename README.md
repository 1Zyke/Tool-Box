# Tool-Box

I HAVE CREATED A TOOLBOX APPLICATION WITH IONIC USING THE ANGULAR FRAMEWORK.

Here is the description, I hope you like it :)...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Among the following tasks that can be performed through a menu that we can display the views our application will contain the following:  

1- Startup view showing a toolbox, since this application will be useful for several things. A bit simple, but efficient.

2 - People gender generator, which when entering the name of a person will predict the gender to which it belongs, showing a color in the navigation bar depending on the gender and changing the color of the gender of the message displayed on the screen depending on the gender.

3- View that accepts a person's name and determines the age of the person. Depending on the age it will show a message if it is a baby, child, youth, adult or elderly. Also, display an image related to the person's condition.

4- View to accept a country in English and display all the universities in that country (which is under maintenance) with their name and link to the official website.

5- View that displays today's weather in the Dominican Republic.

6- View about me, where I will show my photo and personal data for future contracts or to know me.
